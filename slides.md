## Differences with airplanes

- wing is flexible/collapsible
- wing is open in front: cell intakes
- there is pressure inside the wing and it varies
- we can change the size of wing during the flight (voluntarily or involuntarily)
- "fuselage" is 8 m below the wing: human is the pendulum
- reducing wing loading can make wing collapse
- connection between human and wing is not fixed (slack/tension): inverted flight not possible, nose-dive requires spiraling
- thrust comes from gravity
- altitude is the fuel
- airflow typically comes from below, not from front
- dome/arc/camber
- stability design
- different mechanism to change angle of attack
- steering

- Data is for a specific airfoil
- Increasing angle of attack (AOA) -> increasing drag and increasing lift
- There is an AOA with optimal glide (optimal L/D ratio)
- A paraglider is typically trimmed to fly close to optimal glide when hands-up
- At a certain AOA, this airfoil stalls
